# Happy Birthday

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 9.0.3.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Live Server

## Features

Feel free to use the Google Redux Devtools to takea  look how the state is working on this application.

**Due to the short time to develop this application they were somethings I wanted to add but I ran out of time.**

I added an extra feature the client requested. The client wants users to have the avility to go back to previous questions to modify answers.

## Notes

-Validation of the form fields(check if actual month exists, lenght, valid birth day, etc). Currently the only validation is the required field.

-Tests

-Actual implementation of the backend to store the data using AWS (Lambdas, DynamoDB, API Getway, AIM)
